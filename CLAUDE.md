## Project Overview

Build a physical button system that controls LIFX smart lights through direct API calls. The system uses ESP32 microcontrollers with MicroPython to create independent, WiFi-enabled buttons that can trigger various lighting scenes and controls.

## Project Goals

- **Primary**: Create a single working button prototype that toggles LIFX lights on/off
- **Secondary**: Establish scalable architecture for 3-7 buttons controlling 5 LIFX lights
- **Future**: Expand to full scene control with visual/haptic feedback

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware Requirements

- **Platform**: ESP32 development boards with built-in WiFi
- **Input**: Tactile push buttons with hardware debouncing
- **Budget**: $50 total for hardware components
- **Quantity**: 1 prototype button, expandable to 3-7 buttons

### Software Stack

- **Firmware**: MicroPython on ESP32
- **Communication**: HTTP client for LIFX API calls
- **Architecture**: Asynchronous programming for sub-second response times
- **Configuration**: JSON-based local storage on ESP32 flash memory

### Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Sub-second from button press to light change
- **Reliability**: Auto-reconnection logic for WiFi failures
- **Independence**: Each button operates without central server dependency
- **Offline Capability**: Local network operation preferred (if not significantly complex)

## Architecture Design Decisions

### System Pattern: Event-Driven Architecture

- **Pattern**: Each button operates as an independent event publisher
- **Event Types**: "ButtonPressed", "LightStateChanged", "NetworkConnected"
- **Multi-Light Support**: Single button can trigger multiple light commands simultaneously
- **Implementation**: Each ESP32 handles its own event loop and state management
- **Benefits**: Simple, fault-tolerant, truly independent button operation
- **Trade-offs**: No cross-button coordination, limited complex scene sequencing

**Decision Reasoning**: Event-driven architecture provides the simplest fault-tolerant design while supporting multi-light control from single buttons, meeting our independence requirements without unnecessary complexity.

### Event Handling Model

```
ButtonPressed Event → 
  ├── Command: ToggleLight(light_1)
  ├── Command: SetBrightness(light_2, 50%)
  └── Command: SetColor(light_3, "warm_white")
```

- Commands execute in parallel using asyncio for sub-second response
- Each light command is independent - partial failures don't block other commands
- Button configuration defines which lights and what commands to execute

### Configuration Management: File-Based Runtime Configuration

- **Storage**: JSON configuration files in ESP32 flash memory
- **Loading**: Config loaded once at boot and cached in memory
- **Performance**: Zero file I/O during button operations for sub-second response
- **Modification**: Edit JSON via web interface, restart ESP32 to apply changes
- **Structure**: Button-to-light mappings, scenes, and command definitions

**Decision Reasoning**: File-based config provides easy experimentation with light assignments while maintaining sub-second response through boot-time caching, balancing flexibility with performance requirements.

### Configuration File Structure

```json
{
  "wifi": {
    "ssid": "your_network",
    "password": "your_password"
  },
  "buttons": {
    "button_1": {
      "lights": ["kitchen_main", "kitchen_under_cabinet"],
      "action": "toggle",
      "scene": "cooking_mode"
    },
    "button_2": {
      "lights": ["living_room_1", "living_room_2", "living_room_3"],
      "action": "scene",
      "scene": "movie_night"
    }
  },
  "scenes": {
    "cooking_mode": {
      "kitchen_main": {"power": "on", "brightness": 0.8, "color": "warm_white"},
      "kitchen_under_cabinet": {"power": "on", "brightness": 0.6}
    },
    "movie_night": {
      "living_room_1": {"power": "on", "brightness": 0.2, "color": "red"},
      "living_room_2": {"power": "off"},
      "living_room_3": {"power": "on", "brightness": 0.1, "color": "blue"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Network Communication: Cloud API with Hybrid Migration Path

- **Phase 1**: Direct LIFX Cloud API calls via HTTPS
- **Implementation**: REST API calls to `https://api.lifx.com/v1/lights/{selector}/state`
- **Performance**: ~300-500ms response time, internet dependency
- **Benefits**: Simple implementation, well-documented, reliable infrastructure
- **Migration Path**: Clean abstraction layer designed for easy upgrade to hybrid local/cloud approach

**Decision Reasoning**: Starting with cloud API enables rapid prototyping while architecting for easy migration to local protocol, prioritizing working prototype over optimal performance initially.

### Communication Architecture

```
Phase 1: Button → Internet → LIFX Cloud API → Your Lights
Phase 2: Button → Try Local UDP → Fallback to Cloud API → Your Lights
```

**API Abstraction Layer Design:**

```python
# Phase 1 Implementation - Cloud API
async def control_lights(light_ids, command):
    """Send command to LIFX lights via cloud API
    
    Args:
        light_ids: List of LIFX light selectors ["kitchen_main", "living_room_1"] 
        command: Dict with power/brightness/color {"power": "on", "brightness": 0.8}
    """
    url = f"https://api.lifx.com/v1/lights/{','.join(light_ids)}/state"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {LIFX_TOKEN}"}
    payload = command
    
    async with urequests.put(url, headers=headers, json=payload) as response:
        return await response.json()

# Phase 2 Migration - Hybrid Local/Cloud
async def control_lights(light_ids, command):
    """Send command with local protocol fallback to cloud API"""
    try:
        # Attempt local UDP protocol first (~50-100ms)
        return await lifx_local_protocol.send_command(light_ids, command)
    except (LocalProtocolError, TimeoutError):
        # Fallback to cloud API (~300-500ms)
        return await lifx_cloud_api.send_command(light_ids, command)
```

**Migration Requirements:**

- Add UDP socket handling for LIFX LAN protocol
- Implement device discovery via UDP broadcast
- Add fallback logic between local/cloud communication
- Estimated additional development: 1-2 days after Phase 1 completion

### State Management: Stateless Button Approach

- **Pattern**: Each button press queries current light state, then applies opposite state
- **Phase 1 Performance**: ~600-1000ms (two cloud API calls)
- **Phase 2 Performance**: ~100-200ms (two local UDP calls)
- **Benefits**: Simplest implementation, always accurate, no cache synchronization complexity
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower than cached approaches, requires two network calls per button press

**Decision Reasoning**: Stateless provides the simplest implementation with no meaningful performance penalty once local protocol is implemented, eliminating cache management complexity while staying well within sub-second requirements.

**Implementation Flow:**

```
Button Press → Get Current Light State → Set Opposite State → Response
```

**Migration Impact:**

- Phase 1: Acceptable for prototype validation despite being above sub-second target
- Phase 2: Well within sub-second requirement when upgraded to local protocol
- No code changes needed during migration - same stateless logic works with both protocols

### Error Handling: Fail-Fast with Sub-Second Detection

- **Pattern**: Immediate failure detection and user feedback within sub-second timeouts
- **Implementation**: Quick API timeouts (400ms) with immediate LED error indication
- **Benefits**: Clear problem detection, simple logic, honest system feedback, easy debugging
- **Trade-offs**: No automatic retry logic, users must re-press buttons after network issues

**Decision Reasoning**: Fail-fast approach provides transparent system behavior and immediate problem detection, aligning with engineering principles while enabling quick debugging and clear user expectations.

**Error Detection Timeline:**

```
0ms:     User button press
0-400ms: First API call (get current state) with timeout
400ms:   If failed → Error LED activates (sub-second detection)
400-800ms: Second API call (set new state) with timeout  
800ms:   If failed → Error LED activates (sub-second detection)
Success: No LED indication needed
```

**Implementation Strategy:**

```python
# Phase 1: Fail-fast with immediate feedback
async def handle_button_press():
    """Handle button press with sub-second error detection and LED feedback"""
    try:
        # Quick timeout for fail-fast behavior (400ms each call)
        current_state = await get_light_state(timeout=400)
        new_state = await set_light_state(opposite_state, timeout=400)
        
        # Success - optional green flash for confirmation
        flash_success_led()  # Quick green blink
        
    except (NetworkError, APIError, TimeoutError) as e:
        # Immediate error feedback - solid red LED
        activate_error_led()
        print(f"[ERROR][{timestamp()}] Button press failed: {e}")
        return False
    
    return True

# GPIO pin assignments for LED feedback
ERROR_LED_PIN = 2    # Built-in LED on most ESP32 boards  
SUCCESS_LED_PIN = 4  # External green LED (optional)
BUTTON_PIN = 0       # GPIO pin for button input with pull-up
```

**Error LED Requirements (Future Phase):**

- Solid red: Network/API failure
- Quick green flash: Success confirmation  
- Hardware: Simple LED connected to ESP32 GPIO pin

**Phase 2 Benefits (Local Protocol):**

- Faster failure detection (~50-100ms timeouts possible)
- More reliable operation, error LED rarely needed

## Code Quality & Maintenance

### Code Organization: Progressive Architecture Strategy

**Development Plan**: Migrate from single file → functional modules → layered architecture as complexity grows

**Phase 1: Single File Monolith (A)**

```
main.py (all functionality)
config.json
```

- **Target**: Initial prototype with 1 button, basic toggle functionality
- **Duration**: Until file reaches ~200 lines or becomes unwieldy
- **Benefits**: Fastest development, simple debugging, easy deployment

**Phase 2: Functional Modules (B)**

```
main.py (orchestration)
wifi_manager.py
lifx_api.py
button_handler.py
config_manager.py
config.json
```

- **Migration Trigger**: File size, adding multiple buttons, or testing needs
- **Migration Effort**: 2-4 hours (extract functions to files, add imports)
- **Benefits**: Better testing, clear responsibilities, easier collaboration

**Phase 3: Layered Architecture (C) - If Needed**

```
main.py (application layer)
hardware/button_driver.py, led_driver.py
services/network_service.py, lifx_service.py
config/settings.py, config.json
```

- **Migration Trigger**: Multiple hardware types, complex business logic, or team development
- **Migration Effort**: 4-8 hours from Phase 2 (reorganize into layers, add abstractions)
- **Benefits**: Excellent testability, clean abstractions, enterprise-grade scalability

**Migration Decision Points**:

- A → B: When single file becomes difficult to navigate or test
- B → C: When adding multiple light brands, complex scenes, or multiple developers
- Stay at B: If functional modules meet all project needs (likely outcome)

### Version Control Strategy

**Git Setup**: Initialize Git repository from Day 1 for code safety and professional workflow
**Repository Structure**: Claude Code to help set up proper .gitignore, README, and GitHub repo
**Commit Strategy**: Micro-commits with Claude Code suggesting commit points
- **Approach**: Claude Code identifies logical milestones and suggests commits
- **Frequency**: Small working pieces (WiFi connects, button reads, API responds, etc.)
- **User Control**: Developer decides whether to commit at suggested points
- **Commit Messages**: Descriptive of functionality achieved ("Add WiFi connection with auto-reconnect")
- **Benefits**: Excellent debugging history, easy rollback, learning-oriented development process

### Debugging Strategy: Progressive Development Approach

**Phase 1: Serial Console Debugging (Start Here)**
- **Implementation**: Basic print statements and serial monitor output
- **Setup Time**: 5 minutes - USB cable connection only
- **Output Style**: Real-time logs, error messages, development debugging
- **Tools**: Serial monitor in IDE or terminal
- **Benefits**: Simple, reliable, immediate feedback, works on any setup

**Phase 2: Enhanced Serial Logging (Easy Addition)**
- **Implementation**: Add log levels, timestamps, and component identification
- **Setup Time**: 30 minutes - improved formatting only
- **Output Example**: `[WIFI][INFO][12:34:56] Connected to network`
- **Benefits**: Organized logs, easier problem isolation, professional debugging

**Phase 3: Web Dashboard (Future Enhancement)**
- **Implementation**: ESP32 hosts simple web interface showing system status
- **Setup Time**: 2-3 hours - HTTP server + status page
- **Capabilities**: Visual monitoring, wireless debugging, demonstration tool
- **Benefits**: User-friendly interface, remote monitoring, great for demos

**Migration Strategy**: Each phase is additive - web dashboard supplements rather than replaces serial debugging for detailed development work.

### Documentation Strategy: Memory Bank Pattern

**Approach**: Auto-generated living documentation that updates as Claude Code builds features, capturing decisions, implementations, and learning insights.

**Memory Bank Structure**:
```
docs/
├── memory_bank.md (central index)
├── hardware/
│   ├── esp32_setup.md
│   ├── wiring_diagrams.md
│   └── component_selection.md
├── software/
│   ├── architecture_decisions.md
│   ├── api_integration.md
│   └── configuration_management.md
├── troubleshooting/
│   ├── common_issues.md
│   └── debugging_guide.md
└── learning/
    ├── lessons_learned.md
    └── best_practices.md
```

**Auto-Generation Triggers**: Claude Code automatically creates/updates memory entries when:
- Implementing new hardware components → hardware/ docs
- Making architectural decisions → software/ docs
- Solving problems → troubleshooting/ docs
- Discovering useful patterns → learning/ docs
- Completing major milestones → memory_bank.md index

**Memory Bank Entry Template**:

## Future Considerations
What might need to change as project evolves
```

**Benefits**: Captures learning journey, maintains decision context, builds institutional knowledge, provides troubleshooting reference, enables easy knowledge sharing.

### Dependency Management Strategy

**Approach**: Minimal dependencies using MicroPython built-ins only
**Libraries**: Core MicroPython libraries for all functionality:
- `urequests` - HTTP client for LIFX API calls
- `ujson` - JSON parsing for configuration and API responses  
- `asyncio` - Asynchronous programming for responsive button handling
- `network` - WiFi connection management

**Benefits**: No dependency conflicts, predictable behavior, minimal memory usage, maximum reliability
**Trade-offs**: Limited to built-in functionality, may require writing some code from scratch
**Rationale**: Project requirements (HTTP, JSON, WiFi, async) are fully covered by MicroPython built-ins, avoiding dependency management complexity

### Security Strategy

**Approach**: Environment variables with Git exclusion (industry standard for development projects)
**Implementation**: 
```python
# secrets.py (git-ignored)
WIFI_SSID = "your_network"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "your_password" 
LIFX_TOKEN = "your_api_token"

# main.py  
from secrets import WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD, LIFX_TOKEN
```

**Protection Measures**:
- Complete separation of code and credentials
- Git exclusion prevents accidental credential commits
- Clear visual distinction between code and secrets
- Easy credential rotation and environment management

**Threat Model**: Optimized for home IoT projects with trusted physical access
**Benefits**: Prevents 80% of real security incidents (accidental exposure) with minimal complexity
**Trade-offs**: Basic protection suitable for home environment, not enterprise-grade security

### Update Strategy: Progressive Development Approach

**Phase 1: Manual USB Flashing (Start Here)**
- **Approach**: Connect USB cable to each ESP32 for firmware updates
- **Tools**: esptool.py or IDE upload function
- **Benefits**: Simple, reliable, no network dependencies, impossible to brick remotely
- **Process**: Download new code, connect device, flash, test
- **Use Case**: Development phase, infrequent firmware updates, maximum reliability

**Phase 2: Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates (Future Enhancement)**
- **Approach**: ESP32s download and install firmware updates over WiFi
- **Migration Trigger**: Frequent firmware updates needed, multiple devices to manage
- **Benefits**: Remote updates, scales well, minimal downtime, professional deployment
- **Implementation**: Add OTA capability to existing firmware architecture

**Key Insight**: Light assignment changes don't require firmware updates - only configuration file changes via web interface

### Device Management: Progressive Architecture Strategy

**Phase 1: Manual Configuration Per Device (A)**
```
device_001_config.json (individual configs)
device_002_config.json
Physical labels for device identification
```
- **Approach**: Each ESP32 has unique config file with device ID and button assignment
- **Management**: Manual tracking, individual device configuration
- **Benefits**: Simple, explicit control, easy debugging, no networking complexity
- **Duration**: Until managing individual configs becomes tedious

**Phase 2: Centralized Configuration (B)**
```
master_config.json (all device definitions)
Central configuration distribution
Device auto-fetch from central source
```
- **Migration Trigger**: Managing 3+ devices, frequent reconfigurations needed
- **Migration Effort**: 4-8 hours (consolidate configs, add distribution logic)
- **Benefits**: Easy reconfiguration, consistent deployments, scales well

**Phase 3: Auto-Discovery + Web Interface (C) - If Needed**
```
Device auto-discovery protocol
Web-based assignment interface
Visual device management
```
- **Migration Trigger**: Non-technical users, complex device management needs
- **Migration Effort**: 6-10 hours from Phase 2 (add web interface, discovery protocol)
- **Benefits**: Visual management, easy device addition, user-friendly reconfiguration

**Configuration Architecture**: Designed for forward compatibility - individual configs structured for easy consolidation into centralized management

## User Experience Design

### System Startup & Feedback

**Approach**: LED status indicators for clear system feedback
**Implementation**: Error LED serves dual purpose as status indicator during startup
**Behavior**:
- **Boot sequence**: LED blinks during ESP32 startup and WiFi connection (~10-30 seconds)
- **Ready state**: Solid LED indicates system ready for button presses
- **Error patterns**: Different blink patterns for WiFi connection failures, API issues
- **Benefits**: Clear visual system status, user knows when buttons will be responsive

### Network Failure Behavior

**Approach**: Clear error feedback with sub-second detection
**Implementation**: Immediate LED error indication when network/API calls fail
**Behavior**:
- **Network detection**: 400ms timeout triggers immediate error LED activation
- **Error indication**: Solid red LED for network/API failures
- **Recovery feedback**: LED turns off when network connectivity restored
- **User experience**: Clear indication that system detected the problem, not a button malfunction

### Multi-User Button Discovery

**Approach**: Double-press preview system for learning button functions
**Implementation**: Different behavior for single vs double button presses
**Behavior**:
- **Single press**: Immediately toggles lights to new state (normal operation)
- **Double press**: 
  1. Toggle lights to show what the button does
  2. Wait 2-3 seconds for user to observe
  3. Return lights to their previous state
- **Learning process**: Family members can "preview" button effects without permanent changes
- **Benefits**: Self-documenting system, safe exploration, maintains normal single-press operation

**UX Philosophy**: Prioritize immediate usability with clear feedback, enable safe discovery of system capabilities

## Testing

### Testing Strategy: Component Testing + Integration

**Approach**: Test individual modules separately for faster debugging, then validate complete functionality with real hardware

**Component Testing**:
- **WiFi Module**: Test connection, reconnection, and failure handling with mock network conditions
- **LIFX API Module**: Test API calls, response parsing, and error handling with mock HTTP responses
- **Button Handler**: Test debouncing, press detection, and event generation with simulated inputs
- **Configuration Manager**: Test JSON loading, validation, and caching with test configuration files

**Integration Testing**:
- **End-to-end Hardware**: Complete button press → light change workflow with real ESP32 and LIFX lights
- **Network Failure Scenarios**: Test behavior during WiFi outages, API timeouts, and recovery
- **Performance Validation**: Measure actual response times to ensure sub-second requirements
- **Multi-button Coordination**: Test multiple buttons affecting same lights (when implemented)

**Testing Tools**:
- **Mock Functions**: Simple function replacement for network calls and hardware interactions
- **MicroPython unittest**: If available on ESP32, for structured test organization
- **Serial Console**: Real-time debugging and test result monitoring
- **Manual Hardware Validation**: Visual confirmation of light behavior and button responsiveness

**Testing Workflow**:
1. **Component Development**: Write and test individual modules with mocks
2. **Integration Phases**: Test module combinations before full system testing
3. **Hardware Validation**: Final testing with complete ESP32 + LIFX setup
4. **Regression Testing**: Re-test core functionality when adding new features

**Benefits**: Faster debugging cycle, isolated problem identification, confidence in real-world behavior
**Trade-offs**: Moderate setup complexity, need basic understanding of mocking concepts
