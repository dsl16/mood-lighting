# Memory Bank - Home Automation Button Project

## Overview

This memory bank will grow organically as features are implemented, capturing decisions, implementations, and learning insights throughout the development process.

## Current Status

- **Repository Setup**: Complete ✅
- **Phase 1 Development**: Ready to begin
- **Architecture**: Domain-based organization established

## Quick Links

- [Project Specifications](../CLAUDE.md) - Complete project requirements and technical specifications
- [README](../README.md) - Project overview and quick start guide

## Development Notes

*This section will be populated as development progresses with:*
- Hardware setup decisions and component selections
- Software architecture choices and implementation patterns
- Problem-solving approaches and debugging insights
- Performance optimizations and testing strategies

## Memory Bank Structure

As development progresses, this will expand to include:

```
docs/
├── memory_bank.md (this file)
├── hardware/      # Hardware decisions and component guides
├── software/      # Architecture decisions and code patterns
├── troubleshooting/ # Common issues and solutions
└── learning/      # Lessons learned and best practices
```

Each section will be created and populated as relevant content emerges during development.
